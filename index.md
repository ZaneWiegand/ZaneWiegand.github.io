I'm a photography enthusiasts. I'm not professional, but I use camera to record what I am intrested in.

I am a lifelong learner, curious about everything surrounding me, and always hungry for food and knowledge. 

I don't have many friends, and spend a lot of time alone. I try to stay positive and not lose my mind. I push myself forward, and do something challengeable, if necessary.

This site shows a large part of my life, and will accompany me throughout my life, if it is possible. Some posts may be absurd, but I wrote them down seriously.
