- I watched it in the cinema. Fantastic and impressive. People work together, to survive, 
for future. I love the story, about the sacrifice and glory, about crazy and humanity.
- That is the sacrifice. astronauts over 50 were volunteering to trigger the nuke in the moon surface.
The univerce is silent, and they melt without crying, within a second. Golory to the mankind.
- That is the carzy. The engineer who lost his daughter didn't hesitate to do everything for his own obsession.
The moment he successfully uploaded the digital life certificate of Tu Yaya, his smiled, with happiness, without guilty.
He gave Yaya a 'complete' digital life, so he won, and betrayed all living people -- the moon was falling to the earth.
The civilization without human is meaningless. He entered the digital world in the last second, he drowned, and he survived.
He saved the earth, the mankind and the human civiliaztion, but in the digital world. I wonder, what is humanity?
- Carry on, China's Sci-Fi.
